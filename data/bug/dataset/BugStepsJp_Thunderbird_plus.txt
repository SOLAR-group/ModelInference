        "2) Workaround!! I went to the \"Options Menu:Security:Passwords\" and Clicked the \"Saved Passwords\" Button displaying the list of Auto Login \"Usernames and Passwords\" for all the Accounts, and it was displaying the OLD Password for my Account despite the many attempts to enter a new Password!! I then removed the Account from this \"Saved Passwords\" list and tried again to \"Get Mail\" it again complained about Failing the Login I again entered the NEW Password and this time it WORKED and all was well!!!!! So, it appears that if there is an entry in the \"Saved Passwords\" list it Blocks Changes or it just doesn't Change the Account information in the \"Saved Passwords\" list therefore always failing the Auto Login for that Account!!!"
