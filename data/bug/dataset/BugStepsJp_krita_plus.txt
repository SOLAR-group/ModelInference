If we set this value to 1, then all pictures, regardless of having an embedded ICC or not, will be color managed. You may find more information here: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Gfx.color_management.enabled",

Adobe Photoshop's sRGB embedded picture is not affected because Photoshop embeds the official sRGB profile from ICC. Krita is affected because sRGB-elle-V2-srgbtrc.icc is not official and Firefox consider it to be a calibrated ICC."
